		<p>
			If you have points <code>[(x,y), ...]</code>
			And say you want to find a polynomial of degree <code>N</code>
			<br />
			where <code>N = len(points)</code>
			How should you do it?
		</p>
		<p>
			My immediate thought was to turn to linear algebra,
			as we can express our problems as linear systems of equations.
			<br />
			This might not be immediately obvious, but consider how a polynomial is only raising its <code>x</code> terms to the <code>n</code>'th power. <br />
			Since the x values of the points are known, we can transform this problem
			<br />
			Find a quadratic which intersects the points<code>(1,2), (3,2), (2,6)</code>
			<br />
			Into this (easier) problem<br />
			Solve the system
			<code>ax^2 + bx + c = y</code> for each <code>(x,y)</code> in points.
			<br />
			Note that since <code>x</code> is known, we can easily just evaluate them and get the system (in matrix form now)
			<pre>
# each row is [1, x, x^2] for each x in points
# (backwards order makes evaluation in code easier)
A = [[1 1 1]
     [1 3 9]
     [1 2 4]]

b = [2, 2, 6] # what we want (y values for points)
x = [a, b, c] # unknowns, what we're solving for
			</pre>
			Then it comes down to solving <code>Ax = b</code>. which is easy using gaussian elimination.
