## poly

Polynomial interpolation from scratch. With a basic tensor library.

I'll be moving the tensor library to its own repo at some point though.

Live on [github pages](https://ulissemini.github.io/poly/poly.html); and soon to be live on my website.


## BUGS
- Breaks with duplicate points (multiple solutions?)
- Does not do row exchanges when pivots are zero
